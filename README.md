# Mauifish 🐠
Mauifish is a strongly-typed, procedural programming language based on COBOL syntax. It's designed to be stable, robust, fast and predictable, while also remaining easy to read. This repository is for the x86-64 Linux compiler. At the moment, and as far as I know, this is the only Mauifish compiler there is.
