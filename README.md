Mauifish is a strongly-typed, procedural programming language based on COBOL syntax. It's designed to be stable, robust, fast and predictable, while also remaining easy to read. This repository is for the x86-64 Linux compiler. At the moment, and as far as I know, this is the only Mauifish compiler there is.

## Roadmap
Mauifish is far from finished. There are still a lot of things that need to be implemented. Here's a list of the ones that have come up at the moment:
 
 * Array support
 * String access (get a char from a string)
 * Ways to get the length of a string
 * Logic operations
 * String comparison suport in WHILE and IF
 * Subroutine calling
 * Decimals
 * File operations
 * Stdin support
 * Int to string conversions and viceversa

Once all this stuff is up and running, the first _beta_ version of the language will be released.
