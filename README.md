![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-alpha-yellow.svg) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.5-blue.svg)

Mauifish is a strongly-typed, procedural programming language loosely based on COBOL syntax. It's compiled and designed to be stable, robust, fast and predictable, while also remaining easy to read. This repository is for the NariVM compiler. At the moment, and as far as I know, this is the only Mauifish compiler there is.

## About the Language
This section is yet to be completed. Meanwhile, it suffices to say that there are example programs in the `Examples` directory.

## What can be Mauifish used for?
(To be completed)

## Compiling
A `compile` script is included in the repository. Run it and follow the instructions to compile Mauifish. Mauifish consists of two files, `mauifish` and `mauifish_compiler`. Both will be created in the `build` directory when `compile` is ran. If you plan to move Mauifish to anywhere else on your computer, be sure to put both files in the same folder, as one is required for the other to function.

## Use
To compile a Mauifish source file run `mauifish <file to compile>`. Mauifish requieres [NVM](https://github.com/narivm) to be installed in your system in order to work.

## Roadmap
Mauifish is far from finished. There are still a lot of things that need to be implemented. Here's a list of the ones that have come up at the moment:
 
 * Array support
 * String access (get a char from a string)
 * Ways to get the length of a string
 * Logic operations
 * String comparison suport in WHILE and IF
 * Subroutine calling
 * Decimals
 * File operations
 * Stdin support
 * Int to string conversions and viceversa

Once all this stuff is up and running, the first _beta_ version of the language will be released.
